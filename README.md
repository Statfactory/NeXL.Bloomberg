# How to build and use

Running Fake target "Embed" will build a workbook "Bloomberg.xlsm" (already included in this repo).

This workbook is self-contained and can be opened on any machine with Excel 2007 or later, .NET 4.5 and access to Bloomberg.

It contains User Defined Functions which call Bloomberg API.

If you do not have access to Bloomberg then you can use Bloomberg emulator dll (see 'bin' folder).
